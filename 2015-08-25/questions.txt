## How many are you?

In the first lecture, we ran a parallel protocol for counting attendance:

 - Rightmost person per row counts all in row
 - When done counting, raises hand
 - State number in row when called on

after which the instructor gets to gather and sum the row counts.

In practice, this took X time.  This includes

 - Time to start the process
 - Time to compute row counts
 - Time for the instructor to gather counts
 - Time for instructor to do the arithmetic

Consider the following questions:

1. What is a simple model that would predict this time?

   Total time = (T1 time = max time to count number of people in row)
              + (T2 time = time to add two numbers together) * (number of rows - 1)
	      + (T3 overhead time to start count, realize everyone done counting, etc)

2. What about a simple model to predict time for one person to count?

   Total time = (time to count one person) * (number of people)

3. How big should the class be before the parallel method takes less time?

   The class has to be big enough such that the parallelized work of counting in rows and
   then summing later is faster than counting one-by-one. Probably around 30 with at least 3 rows.
